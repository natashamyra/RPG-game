###### 23 July 2023 - Picking up what I have left behind
- UI to follow MVP design pattern
- Managers/Controller to have a bootstrapper at the very top level
  - Design now follow this
    - Bootstrapper - Initialize and handle most of the top level game flow.
    - Manager/Controller - To only handle as what the script's name suggest
      - eg: PlayerData - To only handle anything related to PlayerData.
